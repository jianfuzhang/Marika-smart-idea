# So...What is Smap?
Smap is a iOS app mashup of two web services: Google Maps and Yelp. The purpose of this project is to perform a local search of businesses along the way to your destination. It's built in Swift and powered by third party APIs (Google Maps and Yelp).

#### Here's a scenario when smap is useful:
> You're at home and you're meeting up with your friend for lunch. You're on your way but you're feeling a bit tired and want a cup of coffee. In the normal scenario of using a typical map app, you have
 to erase your destination, add the new destination (coffee shop), get your coffee, and then re-enter your original destination. A bit inconvenient right? smap solves this problem! All you have to do is
 enter your original origin and destination once.

Smap allows you to find places along the way without re-entering destinations!
